# 🖧 Cisco Packet Tracer Projects

A collection of **Cisco Packet Tracer labs** and configurations created during my studies in **networking, IT support, and cybersecurity**.

These projects demonstrate practical skills in **network design, configuration, and troubleshooting** using **Cisco routers, switches, and end devices**.  
They cover key concepts from **CCNA fundamentals**, **LAN/WAN setup**, and **network security basics** to **routing protocols** and **subnetting**.

## 🔧 Topics & Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** simulations  
- **Routing & Switching** (Static, RIP, OSPF)  
- **VLANs, Trunking, and Inter-VLAN Routing**  
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting**  
- **DHCP, DNS, and NAT Configuration**  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
- **Network Topology Design & Troubleshooting**  
- **Wireless Networks & Security Protocols**  
- **Network Monitoring & Performance Testing**

---

## 🎯 Goal

These labs were built to strengthen my **network administration**, **troubleshooting**, and **system support** skills — forming a solid foundation for roles in **IT Support**, **Network Operations (NOC)**, **Cloud Infrastructure**, and **Cybersecurity**.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **VMware / VirtualBox** (for hybrid simulations)
- **Linux (Ubuntu / Kali)** for testing and network analysis

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add advanced **network automation labs** with Python and Netmiko  
- Expand with **security configurations** (firewalls, VPNs, intrusion prevention)  
- Integrate with **cloud networking concepts** (AWS, Azure fundamentals)
