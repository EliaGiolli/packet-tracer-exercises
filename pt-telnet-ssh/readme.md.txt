📄 GitHub README (English)💻 Telnet vs. SSH Configuration Lab (Cisco Packet Tracer)This project documents a network simulation lab performed in Cisco Packet Tracer to illustrate and compare the configuration, functionality, and security differences between Telnet and SSH for remote device management.🎯 ObjectivesConfigure basic network connectivity and IP addressing across the topology.Set up Telnet access on Router 1 ($\text{R}1$), emphasizing its simplicity and inherent lack of security (clear-text transmission).Set up SSH v2 access on Router 2 ($\text{R}2$), highlighting the need for hostname, domain-name, local user database, and cryptographic key generation for secure, encrypted access.Implement Static Routing to ensure end-to-end connectivity between different subnets.Use Packet Tracer's Simulation Mode to visually verify the clear-text nature of Telnet and the encrypted nature of SSH.Perform practical troubleshooting on inter-network communication (ping and connectivity issues).🌐 TopologyThe network consists of two LANs connected by two routers. The administrator PC accesses both routers remotely via different protocols.DeviceInterfaceIP AddressSubnet MaskDescriptionPC_AdminNIC$192.168.1.10$$255.255.255.0$Admin LANRouter1 (R1)G0/0$192.168.1.1$$255.255.255.0$Towards Admin LANRouter1 (R1)G0/1$10.0.0.1$$255.255.255.0$Towards R2Router2 (R2)G0/0$10.0.0.2$$255.255.255.0$Towards R1Router2 (R2)G0/1$192.168.2.1$$255.255.255.0$Towards Remote LANPC_RemoteNIC$192.168.2.10$$255.255.255.0$Remote LAN⚙️ Key ConfigurationsProtocolDeviceKey CommandsTelnetR1line vty 0 4 $\rightarrow$ password cisco $\rightarrow$ login $\rightarrow$ transport input telnetSSHR2hostname R2 $\rightarrow$ ip domain-name lab.local $\rightarrow$ username admin secret Admin123 $\rightarrow$ crypto key generate rsa $\rightarrow$ ip ssh version 2 $\rightarrow$ line vty 0 4 $\rightarrow$ login local $\rightarrow$ transport input sshRoutingR1ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2RoutingR2ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1Priv.
